Overview

This project implements a comparative analysis of AVL and Splay trees based on two key performance criteria:

Total number of comparisons performed during operations

Number of rotations required to maintain balance in the tree

The program evaluates these metrics to determine the efficiency of each tree structure in handling dynamic operations.

Features

Implements AVL Tree and Splay Tree data structures.

Supports Insertion, Deletion, and Search operations.

Tracks and compares:

The number of comparisons made during each operation.

The number of rotations performed to maintain balance.

Provides a performance report summarizing the findings.
